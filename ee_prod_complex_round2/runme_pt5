# After inspection of the 1-ns ee_prod_complex :
#
# 1. the protein is moving too much
# 2. we can use the additionl production to get even better lambda values,
# 3. ...and wwe can set initial weights so the simulation doesn't
#    need to spend time learning the weights
#
# I made `complex2.top' with 10x stronger position restraints  (was 0.115 for 2A rmsd fluct)
#[ position_restraints ]
#;  i funct       fcx        fcy        fcz
#   5    1       1.150       1.150       1.150
#  12    1       1.150       1.150       1.150
#  ...

# For ee_prod2.mdp, the lambda schedule was updated with a further round of pylamdaopt,
# and the initial bias weights were taken from the final bias weights of the last round
#
# Startiing conf and position restraint are same as the first round
