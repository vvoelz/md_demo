Ignoring obsolete mdp entry 'ns_type'

NOTE 1 [file ee_prod2.mdp, line 123]:
  For proper sampling of the (nearly) decoupled state, stochastic dynamics
  should be used


WARNING 1 [file ee_prod2.mdp]:
  The Berendsen barostat does not generate any strictly correct ensemble,
  and should not be used for new production simulations (in our opinion).
  We recommend using the C-rescale barostat instead.

Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5
renumbering atomtypes...
Atom 59 'Cl' in moleculetype 'LIG' is not bound by a potential or constraint to any other atom in the same moleculetype.

NOTE 2 [file complex.top, line 79269]:
  In moleculetype 'LIG' 1 atoms are not bound by a potential or constraint
  to any other atom in the same moleculetype. Although technically this
  might not cause issues in a simulation, this often means that the user
  forgot to add a bond/potential/constraint or put multiple molecules in
  the same moleculetype definition by mistake. Run with -v to get
  information for each atom.

NOTE 3 [file ee_prod2.mdp]:
  Removing center of mass motion in the presence of position restraints
  might cause artifacts. When you are using position restraints to
  equilibrate a macro-molecule, the artifacts are usually negligible.
